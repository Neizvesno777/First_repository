    <h1>Работа с GIT</h1>
    <h2>Работа с GitHub</h2>
    <p>Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very
        large projects with speed and efficiency.

        Git is easy to learn and has a tiny footprint with lightning fast performance. It outclasses SCM tools like
        Subversion, CVS, Perforce, and ClearCase with features like cheap local branching, convenient staging areas, and
        multiple workflows.</p>
